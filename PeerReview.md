I reviewed Philip Fowler's notebook for this requirement:
https://github.com/drpafowler/ml-final/blob/main/regression_fowler.ipynb

### 1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
- It's well structured and orderly, but could use additional subsections fo reasier navigation


### 2. Feature & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
- Yes, he clearly had tried various approaches that lead to logically dropping region, log scaling charges, and using smoking and obesity.


### 3. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
- Very much so, it's all clearly stated in his "Model Evaluation Metrics". The cross over table made for a very quick comparison between the models performance.


### 4.  Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
- They are indeed. To his point, I was also surprised obesity wasn't as impactful as smoking was.
- It was particularly cool how clear his feature importance made the features
